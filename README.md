# Skin-Consultation-Manager
The consultation management system for a skincare center is a software application that was developed using Java and Swing. The focus of the project was to follow the Object-Oriented Concepts of programming, which means that the code was structured in a way that objects are created and manipulated to perform specific tasks.

The purpose of the consultation management system is to manage customer appointments and consultations at a skincare center. The application allows customers to schedule appointments with skincare professionals and track the progress of their treatments. It also enables skincare professionals to manage their schedules, view customer information, and provide personalized skincare recommendations.

The application has a user-friendly interface, designed with the Swing framework, which allows users to easily navigate and perform the necessary tasks. The application is also secure, with user authentication and data encryption to protect customer and business information.

The system was developed using an agile methodology, which means that it was built iteratively and in collaboration with stakeholders to ensure that it meets their needs. The system was tested rigorously to ensure that it works as intended and is free of bugs or errors.
